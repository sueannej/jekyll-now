- **Problem**: Lack of VR killer apps that can affect the overall lifestyle
- **Cause**: Existing VR technologies focusing on *entertainment*
- **Solution**: A VR interaction design to support *educational or productivity-oriented* tasks
<br />
<br />
<h2>Proposed Interactions</h2>
1. *A user can explore within or between documents.* If the user moves the finger up or down, the user moves up or down within the document; if the user moves the finger left or right, the user goes to the next or previous document.<br />

2. *A user can get more information by choosing words.* It is expected to get the information from Wikidata which provides rich structured data.<br />
